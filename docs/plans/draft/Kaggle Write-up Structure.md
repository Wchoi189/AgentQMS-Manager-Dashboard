## Kaggle Write-up Structure

Kaggle competition write-ups, submitted as Markdown notebooks, follow a standardized format emphasizing problem-solving, technical details, and impact.  Start with a title, overview, and table of contents; end with key learnings and references.[^1][^2][^3]

## Core Sections

- **Problem Statement**: Define the challenge, dataset insights, and your approach (1-2 pages). For "Vibe Code with Gemini 3 Pro," highlight documentation management needs and Gemini's role in React.js/Python integration.[^4][^1]
- **Methodology**: Detail architecture, models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro prompts for OCR/document processing), code snippets, hyperparameters, and innovations. Use diagrams, flowcharts, and inline code blocks.[^2][^5]
- **Implementation**: Embed key code cells (Python backend, React components), external repo/demo links, and screenshots of AI Studio API usage or app demo. Explain reproducibility outside notebooks.[^3][^6]


## Results and Evaluation

Present metrics in tables, comparing baselines vs. your solution:


| Metric | Baseline | Your Approach | Improvement |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Accuracy | 85% | 92% | +7% |
| Processing Time | 5s/doc | 2s/doc | -60% |
| Gemini Credits | N/A | Optimized | Cost-Effective [^1] |

Include visualizations, error analysis, and ablation studies.[^2]

## Impact and Conclusion

Discuss real-world applications (e.g., efficient document frameworks for Korean enterprises), limitations, and future work. Add video demos (YouTube/Vimeo embeds) and team credits.  Keep total under 20 pages; use headers, bold key terms, and citations for external resources.[^3][^4][^2]
